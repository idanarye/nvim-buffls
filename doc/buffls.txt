BuffLS - Buffer Specific null-ls Source                                 *buffls*

BuffLS is a null-ls source for adding LSP-like functionality for a specific
buffer. This is useful for small scripts that use Neovim buffers for input,
and want to enhance their UX with things like custom completion or code
actions. Writing a separate null-ls source for each such script is too
cumbersome, so BuffLS acts as a single source that redirects the LSP
requests to objects stored in a buffer variable.

BuffLS was created as a supplemental plugin for Moonicipal
(https://github.com/idanarye/nvim-moonicipal), but can be used independent
of it.
